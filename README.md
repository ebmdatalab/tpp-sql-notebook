# TPP high-level clinical data exploration

![status](https://github.com/ebmdatalab/tpp-sql-notebook/workflows/Notebook%20checks/badge.svg)


This is a series of notebooks to explore the TPP dummy data as
supplied us as part of the OpenCorona project

## How to view the notebooks

Notebooks live in the `notebooks/` folder (with an `ipynb`
extension). You can most easily view them [on
nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ebmdatalab/<repo>/tree/master/notebooks/),
though looking at them in Github should also work.

To do development work, you'll need to set up a local jupyter server
and git repository - see `DEVELOPERS.md` for more detail.

## How to cite

XXX Please change to either a paper (if published) or the repo. You may find it helpful to use Zenodo DOI (see `DEVELOPERS.md` for further information)
